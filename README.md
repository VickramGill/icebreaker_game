Icebreaker Game (via Python)

Brief Description on How the "Icebreaker Game" is played / Game Rules

1. Once our game has started, our player that starts the game is Player 0 (Green Circle)
2. We're prompted to move our player in a position that is adjacent (can move up, dowm, left, right, diagonally

3. So our first main step is to move the Player to any valid position (failure to make a valid move will display a "NOT VALID" message, but you have as mnay attempts to make a valid move. 

4. Once we've moved our player, when then have to break and iceblock 

5. Break any iceblock that has not yet been broken, and an iceblock where a player is not present. In a result of clicking in a invalid position to break an iceblock (block that is occupied  or broken), you'll be prompted with the message "NOT VALID", but you have as mnay attempts to make a valid break ice move.

6. Once we've broken our Iceblock, its now the second players turn 

7. The second player (Player 1) now has to go through the sam process, making a valid move and and valid ice break move

8. The goal of this game is to enclose the opponents so they're no longer able to make a valid move, ineventiablly making the player thats no longer able to move, the loser, and the other player, the winner.
